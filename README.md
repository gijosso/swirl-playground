# Swirl 2018 - Subject Playground

# Subject
Tired of mandatory subjects ? Well, this time you chose what you do ðŸ™ƒ !

Whether it is continuing the previous subject, working on a personal
project or experimenting with your favorite web framework; the point is
to have fun. That does not necessarily means it will be easy (you will
need to plan things up ðŸ¤“).

But hold your horses, you must be able to tell:
- **what** you will do
- **who** will work on different parts
- **why** you made such choices

To work on personal project is a great habit to acquire if you are
planning on developing after your diploma, as companies value
profiles that are independent and avid learners (especially american start-ups ðŸ™Š).

Contributing to your **public** GitHub profile is essential, more than your your
Linkedin in my opinion (though incentive are rarely given early).
I recommend you add the Swirl's projects you have done to your
personal Github ðŸŽ‰.
